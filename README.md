# Unconventional-Affinity

Your Augmented Reality Build

Welcome Video (video)


The purpose of this repository is to guide open source users through the assembly process for creating their own Augmented Reality Sandbox. Due to the scope of this project, the multiple assembly steps and technical proceedures necessitate full and detailed documentation using document files, image files, and multimedia, the objective is to provide a one-stop-shop for everything you will need to get started. This project follows in the spirit of the open source community with full documentation and as much support as can be offered in advancing of your own AR Sandbox build. 

Unconventional Affinity (UA) operates as a for profit organization servicing organizations and individuals that are seeking a cost effective yet more expedient solution to obtain a "plug and play" AR Sandbox system. Beyond our commitment to the AR Sandbox being an attainable and accessible open source project, UA has a mandate to develop products that bring Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Telecolloboration to organizations and classrooms around the globe. In keeping with its roots, UA intends to maintain open source documentation for all of its products and focus primarily on offering ready to build AR Sandbnox kits and related technical services.

This repository initially is intended to organize and document all of the information required to facilitate even the least tech savy individual through, the sourcing of components and materials and the assembly and set-up process of an AR Sandbox table (all that is required is the your will to build it and a few nickles). Ultimatelty, our goal is to use this platform to collaborate with makers, developers, enthuasists, and industry partners to develop new and exciting, yet cost effective technology and offer it open source to the world. We look forward to what the future has in store, and invite you to explore new posibiliies in the realm of AR, VR, and AI.  

Do you have what it takes? (video)

Ok so you want to build your own Augmented reality Sandbox right?!?! So lets cover what the major components a required and what it will take for you to build your own. The first element we will discuss is building the physical table, also we are providing a general list or " bill of materials required for a simple build plan. Depending on your background and whether you have any fabrication experience, this may either be the easiest or hardest portion of the overall build process. A simple table can be fabricated fairly easily from some raw stock of 2"x4" boards and plywood sheet that are readily available at any home improvement retailer. A more sustainabily friendly option is to source discarded or surplus building materials. In the following video we will cover a brief on what materials will work and provide some suggestions on ideas on where to most readily and cheaply obatin the materials.

Ok, so now lets talk about the electronic components and how this system works from a electronic perspective. While in term, an Augmented Reality Sandbox may sound like a High-Tech piece of equipment that will require at least someone involved to be a computer science major. The reality is that there are only three major electronic components required to make this system work. First is the PC, in this case a desktop computer with the general specifications that are listed below will be sufficient. Aside from the PC we need an XBox connect sensor to take in the visual input from the sandbox play-space below, and a video projector mounted above to display the Augmented Reality output. 

At this point lets take a moment now to dig in a little deeper to get a grasp on what is happening to create this near real time immersive experience. To simplify the concept of operations, think about watching a movie that is displayed at a certain number of individual still frames images every second. Now imagine being able to touch the tv screen throughout the movie and by your touch, being able to, affect the outcome, or in this case modify what is happening in that movie. This is the concept, of course in the most generalized form, as to how the AR Sandbox hardware and software are working together to "see" changes made in the play-space, and then continually display an "updated image through the projector... back to the play-space. 

So our XBox connect sensor is reading the changes happening in the play-space, while or PC is handling the computation, and the projector keeps updating the new image that is displayed downward in to the play-space. This either sounds simple enough or clear as mud, either way lets keep moving forward and keep this project on track towards completion. At this stage its relevant to talk more specifically about the PC itself, and what hardware / software we will need.

Now that we have the a grasp on all of the general components that you need to source (both building materials and electronic hardware), lets talk about the software. 

Lets talk about Linux (video)

UC Davis Oliver Kreylos...... Have created this amazing suite of software that encompasses so much more than just the Augmented Reality Sandbox project. Our hope is that in building your own sandbox you will be inspired to seek out other projects and for you to discover the mirade of posibillities that await you in the VR / AI realm. 

At this stage we will be direvting you to a series of links directly to the UC Davis web portal for walking through the VRUI enviroment and AR Sandbox software packages.

Let's take it step by step (video)


Ok at this stage you may have it from here, (if so GREAT... Yes, take this thing out and wow everyone!!!) If you are still struggling with a specific issue don't fret. You may have PC software/hardware specfic issues, you may have had a hold up with the physical build of the table, possibily it's an issue with calibrating and troubleshooting kinect to the overall system, or perhaps its something elses. If this is the case it's time to contact us. All of the new and (usually very specific issues), are part of our growth process. We want to hear from you, and our goal is to be as responsive as possible to fielding questions and returning timely and actionable resolutions.

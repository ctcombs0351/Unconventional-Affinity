AR Sandbox build

Abstract

The purpose of this repository is to guide open source users through the assembly process for creating their own Augmented Reality Sandbox. Due to the scope of this project, the multiple assembly steps and technical proceedures necessitate full and detailed documentation using document files, image files, and multimedia. This project follows in the spirit of the open source community with full documentation and as much support as can be offered in the advancement of your own AR Sandbox build. 

Unconventional Affinity (UA) will be operating as a for profit organization servicing organizations and individuals that are seeking a cost effective yet more expedient solution to obtain a "plug an play" AR Sandbox device. Beyond our commitment to the AR Sandbox being an attainable and accessible open source project, UA has a mandate to develop products that bring Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Telecolloboration and Learning to organizations and classrooms around the globe. In keeping with its roots, UA intends to open source all of its products and focus primarily on offering technical services.

This repository initially is intended to organize and document all of the information required for even the least technically skilled or savy individual through the sourcing of components and materials through the assembly and set-up process of an AR Sandbox table (all that is required is the will to build it and a few nickles). Ultimatelty, our goal is to use this platform to collaborate with makers, dvelopers, enthuasists, and industry partners to dvelop new and exciting, yet cost effective technology to the world. We look forward to what the future has in store and invite you to explore new posibiliies in the reealm of AR, VR, and AI.
